# calculator
calculator is a desktop application built using the Java programming language. It implements an algorithm that accepts infix expressions as input, converts the infix expression to postfix, and evaluates the expression to update the GUI. 

A user can select various operands and operators and calculator uses the Infix to Postfix Conversion Algorithm to perform the necessary artithmetic. The input is accepted as a String object and that object is tokenized using the StringTokenizer class. Depending on what the token is, the token is either added to a stack or a queue. As more tokens are accepted the previously added tokens are removed from the stack and queue depending on precedence rules. This results in a new string that is in postfix notation making it easier to perform the proper arithmetic. The GUI was made using JFrame and the datastructures were implemented from scratch.
